This is a very, very simple, single-purpose container.
It starts openconnect, and then haproxy.

Haproxy forwards traffic on TCP4 port 65534 to a single port
on a single host ($UPSTREAM)

Environment variables:

   $OC_USERNAME   Username
   $OC_PASSWORD   Password
   $OC_SERVER     AnyConnect server
   $UPSTREAM      Upstream host
   $UPSTREAM_PORT Upstream port

NOTE

   You will need to run this container with `--privileged` and the `NET_ADMIN` capability (`--cap-add=NET_ADMIN`)
   If you do not, it will not be able to set up routing, and you won't be able to reach the upstream.
